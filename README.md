# Java
This is an RPG I have done. 
Step One : clone the repository
Step Two : Get ride of the .class files ( rm *.class )
Step Tree : Compile with javac *.java
Step Four : run the project with java Launcher.
And boom, you have a player wandering around, collisions and no enemies. 
Feel free to work the best version of this project, you can reach out to me anytime you need help,
I would be glad to help.
